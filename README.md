# Soep_Household_Savings_Analysis
Empirical project analysing household saving behaviour with the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) using Stata.

This repository contains a Stata ".do" file developed as part of a university group project in applied data science for business and economics.
The file includes only the code that I personally wrote for the project. The analysis is based on the GSOEP dataset and explores how household saving behaviour responds to economic and demographic factors.

## Contents
gsoep_data_preparation_and_regressions.do - Stata code for data cleaning, variable construction, and regression analysis (OLS, IV, and logit).

## Methods
- Data preparation: merging household- and individual-level data, generating derived variables, handling outliers, and clustering at the household level.
- Econometric analysis: regression models to assess the impact of various factors on household saving behaviour.

## Notes
- The dataset is not included due to licensing restrictions.
- This code is provided solely as an example of data management and econometric programming skills in Stata.
